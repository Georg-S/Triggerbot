# Triggerbot
A simple external Triggerbot for CS-GO


I won't update the offsets.

To build the Triggerbot, 
  - run the cmake_build.bat
  - then build the project (open the Solution and build it)
  - copy the config.txt and memoryOffsets.txt next to .exe (or if u want to start it out of Visual Studio, copy it next to the Solution)
